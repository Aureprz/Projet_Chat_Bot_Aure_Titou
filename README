Hi. If you're reading this, you probably already know what this program is about. It's a project we have in our first
semester at Efrei Paris and is kind of a Chatbot. This program's just about the first part of the whole project
(out of 3). Without further ado, here's what the Chatbot can do in this part :

- Out of a certain amount of files (text files), here these are French presidents' speeches, you can choose one
of all of them and get the TF-IDF measure for all the words in the file. Also, if you wish to do so, you can get the
TF-IDF of all the words the txt files' directory.

- If you're more interested in something more specific, the Chatbot can either give you the "less relevant" words
(TF-IDF = 0) out of all the files, the rarest ones or the ones the president you chose use frequently.
